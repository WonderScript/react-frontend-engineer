# 📄 Senior Frontend Engineer Roadmap

A complete guide to mastering frontend development at an advanced level for Senior Frontend Engineer interviews

---

## 1️⃣ JavaScript Execution & Memory Management

- **Execution Model:** Event loop, call stack, microtasks & macrotasks
- **Memory Management:** Garbage collection, memory leaks, WeakMap & WeakSet
- **Optimizations:** Avoiding closures causing memory leaks, profiling with Chrome DevTools

### 🛠️ Practice:

✅ Detect and fix memory leaks in a React app using DevTools

---

## 2️⃣ Performance Optimizations & Web Rendering

- **Virtual DOM & Reconciliation:** How React updates the UI efficiently
- **Rendering Strategies:** CSR, SSR, ISR, and SSG in Next.js
- **Optimizing Web Vitals:** FCP, LCP, CLS, TTFB, FID, lazy loading, and reducing render-blocking resources

### 🛠️ Practice:

✅ Optimize a React app's performance and measure improvements with Lighthouse

---

## 3️⃣ Advanced Asynchronous JavaScript

- **Promises, Async/Await, and Error Handling**
- **Concurrency:** `Promise.all`, `Promise.race`, `allSettled`, `AbortController`
- **Web Workers & requestIdleCallback for background processing**

### 🛠️ Practice:

✅ Build a **custom React hook** for optimized API calls & handling race conditions

---

## 4️⃣ Deep Dive into React Internals

- **React Fiber & Concurrent Mode:** How React schedules rendering
- **Understanding Hydration & SSR Issues**
- **Suspense, Error Boundaries, and React’s Reconciliation Algorithm**

### 🛠️ Practice:

✅ Debug and optimize re-renders in a React app using `React.Profiler`

---

## 5️⃣ Mastering React Hooks (All Hooks in React 18)

- **Basic Hooks:** `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useContext`
- **Performance Hooks:** `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `useTransition`
- **Advanced Hooks:** `useSyncExternalStore`, `useDeferredValue`, `useLayoutEffect`, `useInsersionEffect`, `useId`

### 🛠️ Practice:

✅ Implement **custom hooks** for handling API calls, caching, and performance optimizations

---

## 6️⃣ State Management Strategies

- **When to use what?** Local state (`useState`), Context API, Redux, Zustand, Jotai
- **Optimizing State Updates:** Immutable updates, state normalization, avoiding unnecessary renders
- **Advanced Topics:** Server state with React Query, handling WebSockets & real-time data

### 🛠️ Practice:

✅ Build a **Redux or Zustand-based app** that efficiently handles state updates

---

## 7️⃣ Web Security Best Practices

- **Authentication:** JWT, OAuth, session handling, security headers
- **XSS & CSRF Prevention:** Sanitization, CORS, Content Security Policy (CSP)
- **Secure API Calls:** HTTPS, rate limiting, preventing replay attacks

### 🛠️ Practice:

✅ Find & fix **security vulnerabilities** in a React app

---

## 8️⃣ Testing Strategies for Frontend

- **Unit Testing:** Jest, React Testing Library
- **Integration & E2E Testing:** Cypress, Playwright
- **Mocking APIs & Performance Testing**

### 🛠️ Practice:

✅ Write unit tests for components, mock API calls, and automate E2E tests

---

## 9️⃣ Design Patterns & Architecture

- **SOLID Principles & Clean Code Practices**
- **Design Patterns:** HOC, Render Props, Compound Components, Proxy Pattern
- **React Architecture Decisions:** Component composition, maintaining separation of concerns

### 🛠️ Practice:

✅ Refactor an existing React app using design patterns, ensuring modularity and reusability

---

## 🔟 Microfrontends & Scalable Applications

- **Microfrontend Architecture:** Building microfrontends using Webpack Module Federation, managing independent deployments
- **Independent Deployments & Versioning:** Handling multiple apps with different versions in a shared ecosystem
- **Scaling Applications:** Design decisions for scaling frontend applications, cache management, handling large data

### 🛠️ Practice:

✅ Build a **microfrontend** with Webpack Module Federation and ensure independent deployments

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ System Design for Frontend

- **Frontend System Design:** Scalability, modularity, and architecture decisions for frontend applications
- **API Integrations:** Efficient API calls, caching strategies, GraphQL, and REST optimizations
- **Data Management:** Use of Immutable vs Mutable structures, data consistency

### 🛠️ Practice:

✅ Design a **scalable frontend system**, optimize API calls, plan for data consistency

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Advanced JavaScript Patterns & Immutability in React & JavaScript

- **Mutable vs Immutable:** Difference in behavior, optimizations, and pitfalls in React state management
- **Advanced Patterns:** Proxy design pattern, observing mutable objects for changes, using `WeakMap`, `Map`, and `Set`
- **Immutability in React:** Efficient updates to avoid unnecessary renders, deep equality checks, and `Immer.js` usage

### 🛠️ Practice:

✅ Implement **immutability** patterns in React for large-scale state management, refactor mutable objects to immutable ones to improve performance
